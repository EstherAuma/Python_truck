OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING(OOP)
oop is the concept of pragramming that advocates creating software based on real world objects e.g windows operating system, apple fruits for apple computers
-craeting software based on real word objects
-All objects are coming from a class
-A class is a blueprint of an object
-An object is an instance of a class.
e.g Eve is my blue print and I am an instance of Eve.


CONCEPTS OPP
>Abstraction.(means being specific)
-abstraction is the level of representation eg animal(domestic, wild)
computer(laptops,desktops), 
 
>Inheritance.
-The main class can be divided into subclasses and the subclasses can not exist when the main class is deleted
-In real world ,an object can take on more than one property from different classes.
*Is the ability of an object to take up the property of the super class.

>Polymorphism.
-Polymorphism is ability of an object to take two or more different forms eg
using a tooth for the knife.

>Encapsulation
-Encapsulation is the ability to restrict access to some contents of a class from others.
-It comes from the word capsuole.


>Overloading and overriding
-
-Classes are written in singular eg class country, class computer, class animal, class laptop.
-If you want to identify a class you use a phrase 'is a'
-The name of a class is supposed to be singular eg osman is a teacher, toyota is a car, subaru is a car

NOTES2
-There are things human beings do to themselves and then to others
-Behavior is how you do those things.
-Methods are the things that you do.

-What was called a function in structured programming is now called a method in oop.
-Function statement is now a behavior for this matter.
-The lines in the fuction are reffered to as behavior and function is a method.
