#Syntax for variable naming in python
#The name of a variable should not start with a number {1,2}
#the name of a variable should not start with symbols [#,@,&]
#Don't leave space with compound variable name with more than one word {in such a case ,we use pay-as-you-earn or use camel notion eg PayAsYouEarn}
#Use relatable variable names or words e.g [salary-income-grossprofit] 
#It is recommended to start a variable name with small letters.
#In python, any variable name should have a value eg {salary= one thousand}
#Try to use shorter variable name eg salary=sal, g income= gross income.
#don't use special keywords as variables.
