WHAT IS DEBUGGING?
Is the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in your code.

What is a bug?
Is a written code which doesn't give a developer a desired output.
is a glitch in software that prevents a program from disired output.
Is a mistake that prevents a program from being executed properly.

How do we classify bugs?
1. Syntax errors also known as coding bugs: errors that come as a result of missuse of the language.
e.g spelling errors, passing arguments where they are not neede.
They occue during the process of building, normally includes missuse of funtions, variables,parameters. 
They are underlined by IDE's

2. Logical errors: Areerrors that occur when the step taken during programming doen't solve the program corectly,
 these occur when the step taken to solve a problem is not correctly done
The application works pefectly but does not produce the expected output

3. Design bug: It's an error introduced into the system during the design process.

4.Runtime errors: These occurs when the application tries to perform a program that is not allowed.
These are normally discovered duringthe process of running the script.e.g when you divide any number by zero u get a runtime error, diving a string by an integer.

DEBUGGING AND TESTING
Testing refers to checking on the limit of your code.

DEBUGGING CYCLE
Step1: Writing the code
step2: Check if it's working.
Step3(dependent on step2): If it's not working then debug.
Step4: If it's working then you are done and go back to Step1.

THE BUG SEEKING CYCLE
Step1: Writing code
step2: Trying tobreak the code or Testing
Step3: If you succed in breaking then debug.
Step4:If you fail to break it then you are okay and then can go back to step one.

PRINCIPLES OF DEBUGGING
1.Catch your bug as early as possible.
>Catch your bug early to only have one bug at a time.
>Look whare you have been working on to find the bug.
>Always work in small chunks of code, avoid large chunks of code.
>If you are using githubs, make small commits.
2.Bugs not cought early are not easy to find because the details are not in your mind
